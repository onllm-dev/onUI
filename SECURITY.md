## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainers.

When reporting, include:
- impact summary
- reproduction steps
- affected versions
- proof-of-concept (if available)

Do not open public issues for exploitable vulnerabilities until a fix is available.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch state is actively supported.

# onUI Usage Guide

## Basic Flow

1. Open the target web page.
2. Open the extension popup.
3. Toggle `This Tab` on.
4. Use the floating onUI launcher to start annotating.
5. Save notes and copy output when needed.

## Annotation Dialog

Each annotation supports:
- comment
- intent (`fix`, `change`, `question`, `approve`)
- severity (`blocking`, `important`, `suggestion`)

## Notes

- onUI is tab-scoped: enabling one tab does not enable others.
- New tabs start with onUI off.
- Restricted browser pages (for example `chrome://`) are unsupported.
